> For documentation, go to the [main](https://github.com/NotLawson/rainfall-tracker/tree/main) branch

## Quick start

Clone this repository.

The data and config have been prefilled, so all you need to do is install `flask` (`pip install flask`) and run `main.py` (`python3 main.py`)

> Note: This data is AI-generated. I am too lazy to do it, and it seems the AI was to, judging by the zig zags in the graph. This is only to be used as an example of how this app works
