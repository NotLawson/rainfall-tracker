# Rainfall Tracker

This is a personal tracker for the rainfall up at Cooran. There is limited internet availability up there, so this can be self hosted.

It consists of <no> parts:
- Main Python Script: Runs on the NAS, provides webpage and logs data in the database
- Database Python Script: Manages the database using Elara
